  - [ ] Wrapup function
    After acting on value.
    Update touched date and count, etc.
  - [ ] Create records
  - [ ] Delete records
  - [ ] Edit records
    Open in editor, etc.



* Bugs [0/2]
  - [ ] When piping multiple values to `pbcopy` only the last one
  - [ ] When command in config.yaml has space (eg `ls -la`) the command will fail
    Because "ls -la" is not a command.
    Need to split on spaces, use the first as command, rest as args.



* New features [0/2]
  - [ ] Browse! Sheesh.
  - [ ] Allow user to pipe to arbitrary tools
    Via command line option or config.yaml



* Would be nice / optimizations [0/2]
  - [ ] Pass pointers to `conf` instead of copies
  - [ ] Error messages from shell commands?
    Currently "Error running `/usr/bin/open wicked game`: exit status 1" instead of "The file /Users/richardmavis/Code/go/src/gitlab.com/u/rmavis/gostar/wicked does not exist."
