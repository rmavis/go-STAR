* Todo [7/10]
  Always: grep -i "todo" *.go
  - [X] Create records
  - [X] Delete records
  - [X] Wrapup function
    After acting on value.
    Update touched date and count, etc.
  - [X] Edit records
    Will need to pass an additional parameter to `updateStoreFile`. It will be a function that determines whether the record from the store "matches" the record in question.
    Will need to expand maybe `collateRecordsByIndex` to collate and return a slice of slices of records: the first element in each subslice will be the old one, and that will be the one to compare on, and the second element in each subslice will be the new one, and that will be the one that gets saved to the store.
  - [X] Don't edit records if they haven't been changed
  - [X] When no records match, say so and quit
  - [X] When one record matches, act immediately?
    Except delete.
  - [ ] Refactor / reorganize / clean code
  - [ ] Improved documentation
  - [ ] New readme



* Bugs [1/4]
  - [X] When writing to backup file, only wanted records are part of `records`!!!!!
  - [ ] When piping multiple values to `pbcopy` only the last one
  - [ ] When command in config.yaml has space (eg `ls -la`) the command will fail
    Because "ls -la" is not a command.
    Need to split on spaces, use the first as command, rest as args.
  - [ ] Error when changing permissions of backup file



* New features [3/3]
  - [X] Browse! Sheesh.
  - [X] Allow user to type "all" at prompt to act on all matches
  - [X] Allow user to pipe to arbitrary tools
    Via config.yaml



* Would be nice / optimizations [1/4]
  - [ ] Pass pointers to `conf` instead of copies
  - [ ] Allow user to pipe to arbitrary tools via command line option?
  - [ ] Error messages from shell commands?
    Currently "Error running `/usr/bin/open wicked game`: exit status 1" instead of "The file /Users/richardmavis/Code/go/src/gitlab.com/u/rmavis/gostar/wicked does not exist."
  - [X] Better message in prompt
    Include the command name, etc
